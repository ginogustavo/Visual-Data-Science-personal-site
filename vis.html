            Mortality rates for leading causes of death in every U.S. county

          <p>
            This graph is found in a article on fivethirtyeight.com titled "35
            Years Of American Death". I find this graph interesting because it
            displays bunch of information in a single chart, it shows not only
            the top cause of death in the last decades but numbers in each end
            of the study plust a trend where we can appreciated how drastic was
            the rise. I acknowledge the most tough work was on collecting the
            data but this visualization also attemps foster the awareness within
            the population about this matter, even to the less educated people.
          </p>

            However, these estimates come with some uncertainty.For counties
            with very small populations or causes with few deaths, such as
            “forces of nature, war and legal intervention,” the uncertainty is
            greater
